    <h1> Importance of meta tag and Doctypes</h1>
    <h2>Meta Tag</h2><hr>
    <p>Meta tags are pieces of code on a webpage that describe what the webpage is about.<br>

        Meta tags, sometimes referred to as meta data, include the title tag, meta description tag and the keywords tag (although the meta keywords tag is now rarely used) and a few others.<br>
        
        Meta tags live in the “head” section of a webpage, positioned at the top of the webpage on the code side.</p><br>
        <strong><p>Why Are Meta Tags Important</p></strong><br>
        <p>Meta tags serve a key role in search engine optimization, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Helping the search engines determine the topic of your webpage</li>
            <li>Helping people understand the contents of your webpage</li>
            <li>Avoiding duplicate content issues</li>
            <li>Driving clicks and organic search traffic</li>
        </ul><hr/>
    <h2>Doctypes</h2>
    <p>The HTML document type declaration, also known as DOCTYPE, is the first line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document.<br> The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.<br> This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.</p>
